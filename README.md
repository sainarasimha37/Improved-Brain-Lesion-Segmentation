# Transfer Learning for Enhanced Brain Lesion Segmentation: A Study Utilizing U-Net and DeepLabV3 Models

## Overview
This research project focuses on the application of convolutional neural network models, specifically U-Net and DeepLabV3, for the segmentation of ischemic stroke lesions in MRI scans. Utilizing the multimodal datasets BRATS2015 and ISLES 2015, we demonstrate the efficacy of these models in medical image analysis.

## Datasets
- *ISLES 2015*: Comprises multimodal MRI scans of patients who have suffered ischemic strokes, including DWI, T1, T1c, T2, and FLAIR sequences.

The dataset is used to train and validate the models, providing a comprehensive view of the tumours and stroke lesions.

## Model Performance
- The *U-Net model* showed significant improvements in Dice Score and Sensitivity, indicating robust learning and generalization capabilities. It outperformed the DeepLabV3 model in both training and validation metrics.
- The *DeepLab model* demonstrated slower learning, suggesting a need for further optimization.

## File Formats
- .nii (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative): Used for storing MRI data.

## Research Findings
The U-Net model is more suitable for ischemic stroke lesion segmentation tasks with higher accuracy and sensitivity, making it a promising tool for medical diagnostics and research.

## Future Prospects
The research opens pathways for further optimization of U-Net and integration into clinical workflows. It also suggests potential for the model's application across different medical imaging modalities and conditions.
